# Mokujin

Mokujin (v1.0.1) is a discord bot that fetches Tekken 7 framedata.  
It uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) v1.2.5+ and is updated to use Python 3.6+

The bot now has all the functionalities currently planned and it seems to work well and is somewhat stable. Currently, the data the bot uses is being updated to season 3, and the rest of the season 3 data will be updated either on request or when we see a mistake.

Framedata acquired from RBNorway and community


## If you want to use this:

Clone this to a linux server that has Python 3.6.0+ with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) 
You need your own discord bot ([instruction](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)) and have the tokens in the`src/resources/config.json`. You can add a feedback channel there also.


The executable is `src/mokujin.py`.

!character move        -    get frame data of a move from a character
